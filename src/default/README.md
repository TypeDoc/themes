Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/logotype/LeapMotionTS.git`.

Import the library and create an instance of the Controller class. What you'll get from the `LEAPMOTION_FRAME` handler is a `Frame` instance,
with strongly typed properties such as `Hands`, `Pointables`, `Direction`, `Gestures` and more:

Optionally, you can simply call `controller.frame()` e.g. in your main loop, or implement the `Listener` interface for callbacks.
